# Merkle Root Extension Specification

- **Title:** Merkle Root
- **Identifier:** <https://stac-extensions.github.io/merkle/v1.0.0/schema.json>
- **Field Name Prefix:** `merkle`
- **Scope:** Item, Collection, Catalog
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @jonhealy1
  
This extension specifies a way to ensure metadata integrity for STAC Items, Collections, and Catalogs by encoding them in a Merkle Tree via hashing. Items are hashed using a hash function (e.g., SHA-256), and this hash is stored as a field in an Item's properties. Details concerning the methods used for hashing are stored in a separate object. To produce the Merkle root identifier for a Collection, the hash from every Item is taken into account. This process ensures the integrity of STAC Items and Collections. Additionally, where multiple Collections make up a Catalog, the Merkle root identifiers and collection hashes from each Collection can be used to create a Merkle root identifier for the whole Catalog. 

- Examples:
  - [Item example](examples/item.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Item.
  - [Collection example](examples/collection.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Collection.
  - [Catalog example](examples/catalog.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Catalog.
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

| Field Name           | Type                               | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `merkle:item_hash`     | string                             | **REQUIRED** (in Items). A cryptographic hash of the Item's metadata, used to verify the integrity of the Item.  |
| `merkle:collection_hash`   | string                        | **REQUIRED** (in Collections, Catalogs). **Optional** in Items. Specifies how hashes were computed. Items inherit this from their parent Collection but may include it if they use a different method.     |
| `merkle:hash_method`   | [Hash Method Object](#hash-method-object) | **REQUIRED** (in Collections, Catalogs). An object describing the method used to compute merkle:item_hash, merkle:collection_hash, or merkle:root, including the hash function, fields included, ordering, and any special considerations.    |                       |
| `merkle:root`          | string                             | **REQUIRED** (in Collections, Catalogs). The Merkle root hash representing the Collection or Catalog, used to verify the integrity of all Items and sub-Collections/Catalogs.                      |

### Additional Field Information

#### merkle:item_hash

- **Type:** string
- **Description:** A cryptographic hash of the Item's metadata, computed according to the method specified in `merkle:hash_method`. This hash allows users to verify that the Item's metadata has not been altered.

#### merkle:collection_hash

- **Type:** string
- **Description:** A cryptographic hash of the Collection's own metadata, computed according to the method specified in the Collection's `merkle:hash_method`. This hash allows users to verify that the Collection's metadata has not been altered.

#### merkle:hash_method

- **Type:** Hash Method Object
- **Description:**
    - An object that specifies how `merkle:item_hash`, `merkle:collection_hash`, or `merkle:root` was computed, including:
        - The hash function used.
        - The fields included in the hash computation.
        - The ordering of hashes when building the Merkle tree.
        - Any special considerations (e.g., serialization format).
    - This provides transparency and allows users to accurately verify the hashes.
- **Usage:**
    - **Collections and Catalogs:** This object is **REQUIRED** and must be included in the `properties` object.
    - **Items:** Items inherit the `merkle:hash_method` from their parent Collection by default. An Item can optionally include its own `merkle:hash_method` if it uses a different hash method than the Collection.
#### merkle:root

- **Type:** string
- **Description:** The Merkle root hash representing the Collection or Catalog. It is computed by building a Merkle tree from the `merkle:item_hash` values and `merkle:collection_hash` (for Collections), or from the `merkle:root` and `merkle:collection_hash` values of child Collections and Catalogs (for Catalogs). This root hash provides a single value that represents the integrity of all underlying Items, Collections, and Catalogs.

### Hash Method Object

The `merkle:hash_method` object provides details about the hash computation method used for `merkle:item_hash`, `merkle:collection_hash`, and `merkle:root`.

| Field Name     | Type   | Description                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `function`         | string | **REQUIRED**. The cryptographic hash function used (e.g., `sha256`, `sha3-256`). 
| `fields`          | [string] | **REQUIRED** (for Items and Collections). An array of fields included in the hash computation. Use `"*"` or `"all"` to indicate that all fields are included. For nested fields, dot notation should be used (e.g., `properties.datetime`, `assets.image`). 
| `ordering`         | string | **REQUIRED** (for Collections and Catalogs). Describes how the hashes are ordered when building the Merkle tree (e.g., "ascending by hash value"). 
| `description`          | string | Optional. Additional details or notes about the hash computation method, such as serialization format or any special considerations. |

## Computing Hashes and Merkle Roots

### Computing `merkle:item_hash`
1. Prepare Metadata:
   - Include all fields specified in `merkle:hash_method.fields`.
   - If `fields` is "*" or "all", include all fields of the item.
2. Serialize Metadata:
   - Use canonical JSON serialization with sorted keys and consistent formatting.
   - Ensure consistent encoding (e.g., UTF-8).
3. Compute Hash:
   - Apply the specified cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the serialized metadata.
  
### Computing `merkle:collection_hash`
1. Prepare Metadata:
    - Include all fields specified in `merkle:hash_method.fields` in the Collection.
    - If fields is "*" or "all", include all fields of the Collection.
2. Serialize Metadata:
    - Use canonical JSON serialization with sorted keys and consistent formatting.
    - Ensure consistent encoding (e.g., UTF-8).
3. Compute Hash:
    - Apply the specified cryptographic hash function to the serialized metadata.

### Computing `merkle:root` for Collections and Catalogs
1. Collect Hashes:
   - For **Collections**:
       - Gather `merkle:item_hash` values from all Items.
       - Include the `merkle:collection_hash` of the Collection itself.
   - For **Catalogs**:
       - Gather `merkle:collection_hash` and `merkle:root` values from all child Collections and Catalogs.
       - Include the `merkle:collection_hash` of the Catalog itself (if applicable).
2. Order Hashes:
   - Order the hashes according to the method specified in `merkle:hash_method.ordering`.
3. Build Merkle Tree:
   - Pairwise hash the ordered hashes, proceeding up the tree until a single hash remains â€” the `merkle:root`.
4. Include `merkle:hash_method`:
   - Specify the method used in the Collection's or Catalog's `merkle:hash_method` field, including any details necessary for users to replicate the process.

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

**Note:** This extension is currently a proposal and is open for feedback from the STAC community. Your input is valuable to refine and adopt the Merkle Root Extension.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
