# Merkle Tree Extension Specification

- **Title:** Merkle Tree
- **Identifier:** <https://stacchain.github.io/merkle-tree/v1.0.0/schema.json>
- **Field Name Prefix:** `merkle`
- **Scope:** Item, Collection, Catalog
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @jonhealy1

This extension specifies a way to ensure metadata integrity for STAC Items, Collections, and Catalogs by encoding them in a Merkle tree via
hashing. Each STAC object (Item, Collection, or Catalog) is hashed using a hash function (e.g., SHA-256), and this hash is stored in the
object's properties under the `merkle:object_hash` field. Details concerning the methods used for hashing are stored in a separate object
called `merkle:hash_method`. To produce the Merkle root identifier for a Collection or Catalog, the hashes from its child objects are taken
into account. This process ensures the integrity of all STAC objects within the hierarchy.

- **Examples:**
  - [Item example](examples/item.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Item.
  - [Collection example](examples/collection.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Collection.
  - [Catalog example](examples/catalog.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Catalog.
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Fields

The fields in the table below can be used in these parts of STAC documents:

- [x] Catalogs
- [x] Collections
- [x] Item Properties (incl. Summaries in Collections)
- [ ] Assets (for both Collections and Items, incl. Item Asset Definitions in Collections)
- [ ] Links

| `merkle:object_hash` | string                                    | **REQUIRED** in Items, Collections, and Catalogs. A cryptographic hash of the object's metadata, used to verify its integrity.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Additional Field Information

#### `merkle:object_hash`

- **Type:** string
- **Description:** A cryptographic hash of the object's metadata (Item, Collection, or Catalog), computed according to the method specified in
  the `merkle:hash_method`. This hash allows users to verify that the object's metadata has not been altered.

#### `merkle:hash_method`

- **Type:** [Hash Method Object](#hash-method-object)
- **Description:**
  - An object that specifies how `merkle:object_hash` and `merkle:root` were computed, including:
  - The hash function used.
    - The fields included in the hash computation.
    - The ordering of hashes when building the Merkle tree.
    - Any special considerations (e.g., serialization format).
  - This provides transparency and allows users to accurately verify the hashes.
- **Usage:**
  - **Collections and Catalogs:** This object is **REQUIRED**.
  - **Items:** Items inherit the `merkle:hash_method` from their parent Collection by default. An Item can optionally include its own
    `merkle:hash_method` if it uses a different hash method than the Collection.

#### `merkle:root`

- **Type:** string
- **Description:** The Merkle root hash representing the Collection or Catalog. It is computed by building a Merkle tree from the `merkle:object_hash`
  values of its child objects and, optionally, its own `merkle:object_hash`. This root hash provides a single value that represents the integrity of
  all underlying objects.

### Hash Method Object

The `merkle:hash_method` object provides details about the hash computation method used for `merkle:object_hash` and `merkle:root`.

| Field Name    | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `function`    | string     | **REQUIRED**. The cryptographic hash function used (e.g., `sha256`, `sha3-256`).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `fields`      | \[string\] | **REQUIRED** (for all objects). An array of fields included in the hash computation. Use `"*"` or `"all"` to indicate that all fields are included. For nested fields, dot notation should be used (e.g., `properties.datetime`, `assets.image`). |
| `ordering`    | string     | **REQUIRED** (for Collections and Catalogs). Describes how the hashes are ordered when building the Merkle tree (e.g., "ascending by hash value").                                                                                                |
| `description` | string     | Optional. Additional details or notes about the hash computation method, such as serialization format or any special considerations.                                                                                                              |

## Computing Hashes and Merkle Roots

### Computing `merkle:object_hash`

1. **Prepare Metadata:**
   - Include all fields specified in `merkle:hash_method.fields`.
   - If `fields` is `"*"` or `"all"`, include all fields of the object.
2. **Serialize Metadata:**
   - Use canonical JSON serialization with sorted keys and consistent formatting.
   - Ensure consistent encoding (e.g., UTF-8).
3. **Compute Hash:**
   - Apply the specified cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to the serialized metadata.

### Computing `merkle:root`

1. **Collect Hashes:**
   - Gather `merkle:object_hash` values from all child objects (Items, Collections, or Catalogs).
   - Include the `merkle:object_hash` of the Collection or Catalog itself.
2. **Order Hashes:**
   - Order the hashes according to the method specified in `merkle:hash_method.ordering`.
3. **Build Merkle Tree:**
   - Pairwise hash the ordered hashes, proceeding up the tree until a single hash remainsâ€”the `merkle:root`.
4. **Include `merkle:hash_method`:**
   - Specify the method used in the Collection's or Catalog's `merkle:hash_method` field, including any details necessary for users
     to replicate the process.

## Relation types

This extension does not introduce any new relation types. The standard STAC relation types should be used as applicable in the
[Link Object](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#link-object).

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

**Note:** This extension is currently a proposal and is open for feedback from the STAC community. Your input is valuable to
refine and adopt the Merkle Root Extension.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid.
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on
your command line run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:

```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:

```bash
npm run format-examples
```
